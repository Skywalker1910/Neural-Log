# Changelog

Kept from Phase 1 onward. Format is loose - what changed and why, newest first.

## Phase 1 - Foundation

- **Fix**: `handleDailyChecklistSubmit()` in `static/js/app.js` referenced
  `completionPercent`, a variable only ever declared inside an unrelated function
  (`populateWizardFromActivity()`). Submitting the daily checklist threw a
  `ReferenceError` client-side. Now computed locally from the answered/total custom
  item counts, same formula as before.
- **Fix**: `templates/index.html` had two elements with `id="checklistWizard"` - a
  dead static block of hardcoded checklist markup (wake time / coffee / breakfast /
  exercise / lunch / dinner radios) left over from before the dynamic wizard was
  introduced, and the real container the wizard populates. `getElementById` only
  ever found the first (dead) one. Removed the legacy block, along with the
  now-unused `toggleSubOptions()` / `getRadioValue()` helpers that only served it.
- **Change**: `SECRET_KEY`, Flask debug mode, and the SQLite DB path now come from
  environment variables (`python-dotenv` + `.env`) instead of being hardcoded in
  `app.py`. See `.env.example`.
- **Add**: `pytest` smoke tests (`tests/test_app.py`) covering registration/login,
  activity CRUD, the daily checklist submission path, and the paths API.
- **Add**: `gunicorn` to `requirements.txt` in preparation for Phase 3 (AWS).
- **Add**: this `docs/` set (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) and a
  rewritten root `README.md`.
